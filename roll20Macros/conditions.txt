[Danger Zone](#" class="showtip" title=" Characters are in the DANGER ZONE when half or more of their heat is filled in.){[Engaged](#" class="showtip" title=" If a character moves adjacent to a hostile character they both gain the ENGAGED status for as long as they remain adjacent to one another. Ranged attacks made by an ENGAGED character receive +1 difficulty. When characters become ENGAGED by targets of equal or greater SIZE during the course of a movement stop moving immediately and lose any unused movement.){[Exposed](#" class="showtip" title=" Characters become EXPOSED when they’re dealing with runaway heat buildup – their armor is weakened by overheating their vents are open and their weapons are spinning down providing plenty of weak points. All kinetic explosive or energy damage taken by EXPOSED characters is doubled before applying any reductions. A mech can clear EXPOSED by taking the STABILIZE action.)
{[Hidden](#" class="showtip" title=" HIDDEN characters can’t be targeted by hostile attacks or actions don’t cause engagement and enemies only know their approximate location. Attacking forcing saves taking reactions using BOOST and losing cover all remove HIDDEN after they resolve. Characters can find HIDDEN characters with SEARCH.){[Immobilized](#" class="showtip" title=" IMMOBILIZED characters cannot make any voluntary movements although involuntary movements are unaffected.){[Impaired](#" class="showtip" title="IMPAIRED characters receive +1 difficulty on all attacks saves and skill checks.){[Invisible](#" class="showtip" title=" INVISIBLE characters can always HIDE even without cover. All attacks against INVISIBLE characters regardless of type have a 50 percent chance to miss outright before an attack roll is made. Roll a dice or flip a coin to determine if the attack misses.){[Jammed](#" class="showtip" title=" JAMMED characters can’t:n\• use comms to talk to other characters;n\• make attacks other than IMPROVISED ATTACK GRAPPLE and RAM;n\• take reactions or take or benefit from tech actions.){[Lock On](#" class="showtip" title=" Hostile characters can choose to consume a character’s LOCK ON condition in exchange for +1 accuracy on their next attack against that character. LOCK ON is also required to use some talents and systems.){[Prone](#" class="showtip" title=" Attacks against PRONE targets receive +1 accuracy. PRONE characters are SLOWED and count as moving in difficult terrain. Characters can remove PRONE by standing up -unless they’re IMMOBILIZED- instead of taking their standard move. Standing up doesn’t count as movement and thus doesn’t trigger OVERWATCH or other effects.){[Shut Down](#" class="showtip" title=" When a mech is SHUT DOWN:n\• all heat is cleared and the EXPOSED status is removed;n\• any cascading NHPs are stabilised and no longer cascading;n\• any statuses and conditions affecting the mech caused by tech actions -such as LOCK ON- immediately end.n\SHUT DOWN mechs have IMMUNITY to all tech actions and attacks including any from allied characters.n\While SHUT DOWN mechs are STUNNED indefinitely. Nothing can prevent this condition and it remains until the mech ceases to be SHUT DOWN.){[Shredded](#" class="showtip" title=" SHREDDED characters don’t benefit from ARMOR or RESISTANCE.){[Slowed](#" class="showtip" title=" The only movement SLOWED characters can make is their standard move. They can’t BOOST or make any special moves granted by talents systems or weapons.){[Stunned](#" class="showtip" title=" STUNNED mechs cannot OVERCHARGE move or take any actions – including free actions and reactions. Pilots can still MOUNT DISMOUNT or EJECT from STUNNED mechs and can take other pilot actions normally.n\STUNNED mechs have a maximum of 5 EVASION and automatically fail all HULL and AGILITY checks and saves.)
